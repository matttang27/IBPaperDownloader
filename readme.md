IB Paper Downloader
===========

I have no idea why this exists I just felt like downloading all the exams for my IB Subjects

How to use:

1. Open `main.py` up in a text editor (Notepad, Vscode, etc.)
2. Go to the [IB document website](https://www.ibdocuments.com/IB%20PAST%20PAPERS%20-%20SUBJECT/)

3. Copy paste the subject that you want to download (ex. https://www.ibdocuments.com/IB%20PAST%20PAPERS%20-%20SUBJECT/Group%205%20-%20Mathematics/Mathematics_HL/ ) into the **DOWNLOADLINK** variable (line 15)

4. Go to File Explorer and copy paste the file path you want to save the files into the **FOLDERPATH** variable (line 13)

(For example, if your selected path is "C:/Papers/", python will upload all the documents like:

    -> C:

        -> Papers

            -> CHEMISTRY_HL

                -> 1995 May Examination Session

                -> 1995 November Examination Session

                ...

5. Enjoy all the INFO:root logs and feel like a hacker

6. Die in IB

If this program doesn't work for you, it worked for me so suck it :P
